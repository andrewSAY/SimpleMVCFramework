PREPARE FOR WORK:
1. Create folder with name "cache" in root of the project. This folder must include in self two folders: "doctrine" and "twig".
2. Set the resolution on folder "cache" for write and read
3. You must configure settings of connection to database in file config\data_base.php
4. You must create virtual host for web-server of next type (if used Apache):
    Listen HOST:PORT
    <VirtualHost HOST:PORT>
      ServerName yourname.com.localhost
      DocumentRoot "path\to\project\web"
      DirectoryIndex index.php
      <Directory "path\to\project\web">
        AllowOverride All
        Allow from All
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
6. Go to folder orm\bin with help of next commands:
    cd project\path
    cd libs\doctrine\vendor\doctrine\orm\bin
7. Now you must create database on server with help of next command:
    php doctrine lw:pdo:create_database
8. And create schema of data on server with help of command:
    php doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
9. Next step is create proxy-classes with help of next command:
    php doctrine orm:generate-proxies
10. And, finally, create primary data in data source with help of next command:
    php doctrine lw:insert_primary_data
11. Ok, now all is should work. You can get access to panel of management of users, if  you login into program as administrator

NOTICES:
   This program prepared only for work with "Apache".
   If on your web server closed access to module "mod_rewrite", then all requests to program should sent through index.php.
